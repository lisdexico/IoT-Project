## To do:
- //connect to wifi
- upload to database
  - change HTTP request to upload both humidity and temperature to server at the same time (might need to make 2 requests for this)
- //save last few measurements and make prediction straight in code (smooth it out)
- //set threshold and make the light go on
- //Stop if sensors are lost(system failure)
- Send notification if system fails (grafana?)
- use grafana to visualize data
- Write documentation

## Other Notes

- to read from the influxdb database from the command line:
curl -G 'http://localhost:8086/query' --data-urlencode "db=mydb‚Äù --data-urlencode "q=SELECT value FROM temperature LIMIT 1"

- grafana can also do alerts/send notifications so we can set it up so grafana tells us when its above the threshold (or we can do that in the code directly - might still be easier)
